    js engine runs js in browser.
    1996 livewire was the backend for js.
    node is js runtime: environment that allows to run JS outside browser.
    js :1995 by netscape browser people.
    runtime is code executed to execute your code eg. compiler + libraries etc.
    node comes with its own api.
    to install just download it and add the bin folder to path.it has node file in it.
    node has LTS and current version.
    node : to open in repl mode.
    node -v or node --version
    event loop asks V8 to execute callbacks.
    v8 executes and then event loop executes for the rest of the code that is asynchronous.
    node is v8 engine + libuv 
    libuv is a C library used for asynchronous code,for other than what js can do,used for asynchronous IO.
    2019 Deno was introduced.
    2008 chrome came.
    v8 was fast hence we made node in 2009 by ryandahl.
    v8 and libuv communicate.
    runtime environment is everything that my program needs to run: os + libraries + engine + compiler etc.
    global/window is not part of JS.
    in vscode install visual studio intellicode for autocompletion.
    spidermonkey is used by firefox as an js engine.
    node gives us process api .ti si a global object for all available.
    ctrl+l in browser to clear.
    command line arguments: process.argv[0] is /usr/bin/node  and [1] is abc.js and so on.
    v8 is opensource,even Deno uses it.
    global.process<>process,global is same as window in browser.
    web2.0 was when websites became interactive.and user could provide data.
    process.argv is array of strings.
    + for concatenation of strings.
    `${a+b}` for template string. in python f'{}' . ` is called backtick.
    node globals:
        console.log,process,module,__filename,require(),__dirname,setTimeout() etc.
        anything in window or global are not js.they are features provided by node or browser.
    even versions of node has LTS,hence always download even version.
    node is basically a person writting a c++ program that combines V8 and libuv.
    globals are variables and functions build in.
    xml is like json,for sending data and it looks like html.
    v8 lets node run js.
    we have Node.js API's, like fs,http,path,when we call them they are handled by libuv.
    libuv works in all oses
    node.js bindings allow v8 to call low level api like fs,http written in c in lubuv.libuv deals with   input/output etc.
    even python uses libuv.
    web has client server architecture.
    process.exit() to exit.
    node is asynchronous.
    callback function: function that we give to be executed later time,when some event occurs.
    JSON.stringify({"food":"love"}), it is syncronous/blocking we get '{"food":"love"}'
    v8<>node.js bindings <>libuv 
    node.js bindings are written in c++ in src and lib contains js api provided.
    use nvm to install different versions of node at any point in time: nvm use 16,nvm install 12,nvm install 14.7.0  nvm ls-remote to list,nvm uninstall 14 etc.
    npm comes with node.
    LTS versions go via maintenance phase,but odd versions do not go through maintenance phase.
    ecmascript is a js standard ES6 is the latest big thing in 2016.
    global are objects that are available without any imports.
    cpp cc are two extentions for c plus plus code.
    js is synchronous porgramming language,we can use asynchronous code in it
    js does't support multithreading,because multi threading is hard.but node itself has multiple threads.Where main thread runs v8.
    js is asynchronous in certain environments like node. 
    libuv does I/O
    libuv has eventloop that executes our code asynchronously.
    we call asynchronous function in Node,it gets put on EventLoop which tells Os rn ti and notify when ready.
    libuv has thread pools,hence it is a multithreading usually 4 threads.
    not all operations are done by thread pool.
    some are directly done by kernel eg. network things.
    main thread runs V8 and event loop.
    node has 1 main thread and 4 libuv threads.
    event loo executes the callback functions ,hence code that is asynchronous,never come back to Js.only the changes it makes refect in main code.
    eventloop in libuv is a code that executes our asynchronous callback.
    when asynchronous operation expires eventloop executes callback.
    callback stays in queue called callback queue,event loop executes in FIFO queue.
    event queue<>callback queue.
    there are several queues for different types of operationsfor callback queues.
        timers,IO callbacks,setImmediate,close callbacks 

        setTimeout,setInterval,setImmediate ,as soon as possible to be done.
        event loop first checks times if any of them completed,then I/O callbacks,then setImmediate,then close callbacks like closing files.
        event loop while(true){},
        you can use Nginx,Apache with node
    eventloop is in libuv 
    netfix uses node.
    
    node modules:
        
    
    event driven:
        one emitter can have multiple observers .
        event driven programming.
        it is called observer pattern as in how to do event driven programming,eg for a button etc it could be one to many relation.
    
    js is event driven.
    process.on("exit",(code)=>{})executed when you exit. code is exit code.
    even process is an instance of event emitter.
    React uses event driven programming.
    you can have multiple listeners for same even p.on("hi",function1) p.on("hi",funciton2) and both will get executed when event occurs.


#Mosh Hamedani:
    node is used for creating backend.
    API: application programming interface.
    for high scalabe,data intensive and real time apps.
    it is superfast.compared to java etc even small code.
    used in paypal,netflix even better than spring.
    large opensource libraries
    it is a runtime environment,it is not a programming language.
    node is asynchronous/non blocking.eg waiter not waiting for completion,otherwise called syncronous/blocking.
    in node you have single thread.
    node has eventqueue,where it puts things.and thread doesn't wait for database when query.
    node is ideal for io intensive apps.
    it is not best for cpu intensive apps as there is single thread.like video encoding etc.
    node --version
    mkdir first-app
    create file app.js 
    node app.js to run it.
    window,document are not defined in node ,they only  work in browser runtime environment.
    code . to open the current folder in vscode.
    node is a c++ program.

    NODE MODULE SYSTEM:
        console.log("hi there"); global object,and can be accessed anywhere in any file.
        other global objects are like clearTimeout(),setInterval(),clearInterval(). setInterval is to call repeatedly.
        window object represents global variables and functions in browser.
        global.console.log();
        in browser var variables are added to window,but in node things are scoped to module.not even functions.even if var is used,it is limited to that that module only.it is a nice choice by node.
        as in global scopoe there is an overriding for objects of same name. which happens in browser.
        every file is a module.
        variables,functions are confined to that module.
        console.log(module);,module is an object and it is not a global object.it is in every module in a wrapper function.
        creating a module:
            file: logger.js
                module.exports.log=log;
                module .exports is an object that is exported.
            to load a module:
                var logger= require("./logger.js") or skip .js 
                noe logger is an object,you can use const also.
            logger.log("hi");
        intellisense shows methods etc.
        jshint a.js in terminal to check for errors,as it gives better error messages.
        if just one to export: module.exports=obj; now logger is a function not an object.
        node wraps code in a function called module wrapper function to have module level variables like require etc to not have them global.
            (function (exports,require,module,__filename,__dirname){
                require is not global object,it is local to each module.
                exports is a reference to module.exports, you cannot assign to exports but use exports.property to do things.
                at the end module.exports is exported.
                __filename,__dirname are complete paths.
            }) it is an IIFE
        
        Built in modules in node :
            os,fs,http,Path,Process etc.
        const path=require("path");
        var pathobj=path.parse(__filename); this object has useful properties related to this file.
        
        os module:
            const os=require("os");
            var t=os.totalmem();
            var m=os.freemem();
        
        file system module:
            const fs=require("fs");
            const files=fs.readdirSync("./"); this is blocking,it reads all files are in folder,returns an array.
            fs.readdir('./',function(err,files)=>{
                if(err){}
                else{
                    files array.
                }
            }); err if error is there and files if successful.and this is asynchronous.
        
        event module:
            event is a signal indicating something happened eg http listener.
            const EventEmitter=require('events');
                EventEmitter is a clas.
            const emitter = new EventEmitter();
            emitter.emit('messageLogged') this string is event name.
            it is called raising an event.
            emitter.on('messageLogged',function(){});
            it is a listener. on is as good as addListener.
            order is important,listener should be first.
            we can have arguments to emit
                .emit("hit",{id:1,url:""}) this is called event argument.
                .on ("hit",function(arg){});
                hence we can pass data about event.
                we can use arrow functions.
            emit should be of same object,won't listen for other obejects even if used across modules.
            you can create a class and extend EventEmitter class.
                this.emit() or obj.emit() in it.
                obj1.on() or this.on() better way.
            
        http module:
            const http=require('http');
            const server: http.createServer(); create a web server it is an event emittr object.
            server.listen(3000); here 3000 is a port.
            server.on("connection",(socket)=>{console.log("hi")}); connection is prebuild event.
            in browser localhost:3000
            we can use require anywhere in code.
            const server=http.createServer((req,res)=>{
                if (req.url==="/){
                    res.write("hit");
                    res.end();
                }
                if another end point.
            })
            we can have many if blocks for various routes.
            but it gets complex so we use express framework,build on top of http module.

    NODE PACKAGE MANAGER(NPM):
        it is a command line tool.
        registry for modules.for pretty much every problem that you want to solve.
        npmjs.com
        npm -v 
        comes with node,automatically.
        node and npm are independent.
        npm i -g npm@5.5.1 
            install and g is for global not specific to that application,it might need for you to run as administrator.
        package.json contains the information about your application dependencies.
        npm init --yes or just npm init to create it.
        npm install/i underscore ,it is added to package.json as dependency.
        stores package the node_modules
        every node module has package.json in ti even ones you download.

        to use a module:
            first assumes core modules 
            then file or folder in current directory,that might have index.js in it 
            node modules,look there now.
        
        underscore contains lots of utility functions.
        var a=_.contains([11,2,3],2);

        mongoose is a node package to deal with mongodb.

        use JSON.strinify to send json from server as string.and JSON.parse to get object back.
        
        installing a module installs its dependencies as well,all in node_modules to avoid repetition.
        if different versions then it will create node_modules folder within it.
        
        node_modules could grow to be a few hundred megabytes,but all dependencies are stored in package.json hence we can easily restore
        to restore dependencies: npm install or npm i.
        hence don't add node_modules to your source code in git you can use .gitignore file and add node_modules/ to it.
        package-lock.json is for npm to do its job and it contains precise versions.

        semantic versioning:
            Major.Minor.Patch 
            Patch is for bug fixes 
            4.13.6 fix bug we get 4.13.7
            minor adding new features without breaking api.
            4.13.7 to 4.14.0
            if potenitally break existing application then 4.13.6 to 5.0.0
            ^4.13.6 means as long as major is 4 or 4.x 
            ~1.8.3 means both major and minor have to be same. 1.8.x 
            1.8.3 for exact version. you can edit ~ ^ in package.json accordingly.
        
        listing installed packages
            npm list, it shows with versions and their dependencies
            npm list --depth=0,to just see them and not their dependencies.
            npm view mongoose,package.json of that file.
            npm view mongoose dependencies to see dependencies
            npm view mongoose versions,to see all versions.
        installing specific version:
            npm i mongoose@1.2.2 it overrides earlier version.
        
        updating local packages
            npm outdated, to see whihc ones are outdated with respect to what is valid for then and current,latest,wanted available.
        npm update,only of minor,patch releases updated to latest monor,patch.

        npm i -g npm-check-updates
        npm-check-updates or ncu 
        ncu -u updates even major releases,but it only changes package.json 
        to update: npm i 

        dependencies can be development dependencies or production dependencies.
        development dependencies should not go to production.

        npm i jshint --save-dev    , added to dev dependencies in package.json,also in node_modules though.

        uninstalling:  npm uninstall/un mongoose 
        packages are particular to that project.

        global packages : common to all -g to do so.
        npm i -g mongoose.
        npm -g outdated
        npm un -g mongoose 
        index.js is entry point to our packages.you can have a folder with package.json and an index.js as an entry point.or in package.json you can mention the entry point.

        you can publish your own package as well.
