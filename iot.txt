what is iot?
    the iot is the intelligent connectivity of physical devices driving massive gains in efficiecy busines growth and quality of life.

    why:
        efficiency
        improves quality of life.
    
    iot is going to be everywhere.
    it is used by IT,consumer,industry etc.

    everything could be connected to each other and make them talk to each other.
    and be connect to cloud.

    in heart it is:
        sensors and actuators + connectivity + people and processes.
        using internet the data flows.
        there are processes running on it.
    sensors:
        to sense light,humidity,sound,tilt,electricity,leaks,flow,gas,temperature,position etc 
    connectivity:
        using bluetooth,wifi,ethernet,satellite,etc.
        we can control the device using internet.
    people and proceses:
        this data can be used for better decision making or to notify consumer,etc 
        remote monitoring,automation etc 

    eg smart thermostats,connected cars,activity trackers,smart outlets,etc 
    2 billion devices in 2014

    can be used in health,home,etc 

    home and building security,building automation etc.

building blocks of an IOT system:
    hardware:
        microcontroller:
            ardruino,raspberry pi etc.
        shields:
            wifi,bluetooth etc 
        electrical components:
            resistors,copacitors,transistors,semiconductors etc.
        electro-mechanical:
            like a relay(like a switch in wire)
    software:
        IDE
        drivers
        libraries
        database
        cloud to log entries.
        programming language.
    
    iot devices could be talking to each other as well.
    we can use web sockets for devices to connect to each other.
    
    go to arduino to download the ide

    every program is called a sketch.

    bread board os used for demos.
