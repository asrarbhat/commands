to land your dream job
FAANG:  FACEBOOK,APPLE,AMAZON,NETFLIX AND GOOGLE.
there are other fang like companies. eg. microsoft,linkedin,whatsapp etc.these have also multi billion valuation.
there could be different interview processes.but core remains same.

process begins with assigining you a recruiter,gut chuck interview 15-30 minutes.
then you have an interview with someone from engineering,it would be 1 hour video call where you get to solve one or two technical problems.

in this course you would learn to solve these technical problems.

then there is an onsite interview,this is whole day,with 5 different interviews with 4 engineers and one hr culture interview,you solve the same kind of technical problems,diffent engineers to avoid bias.

three keys to technical interviews:
    technical knowledge comprising of data structures and algorithms.
    critical and abstract problem solving
    communication.

indices start from zero and if you need nonzero numbers add one to indices .

STEPS:

step1: verify the constraints.
        are all the numbers positive or can there be negatives,
        are there duplicate numbers in the array,
        will there always be a solution available,
        what do we return if there's no solution.
        can there be multiple solutions.
step2: turn these edge cases into test cases.say on paper.
think about a brute force solution and its time complexity.
double check for errors.
test your code for all test cases.even in interview.
figure your time and space complexity of your algorithm.
make tradeoffs between memory and compute to get ideal algorithm.

use hashmap for making your lookups O(1)
using hashmaps is the best trick for performance.


check if two pointers can solve the problem,say with different speeds over the linked list or array and second choice shoudl be using a hashmap.
