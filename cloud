NPTEL: CLOUD COMPUTING

cs50:
    students:
        off premise storage,applications,machines.
        you don't want to cool and fix stuff.
    it is a rebranding of outsourcing jobs.
    possible because speed is faster hence it is as good as photos being in your own space.

    IaaS: Infrastructure as a service,started by amazon.
    
    easy to scale up and down (it is automatic/ autoscaling) when say your website gets mentioned on buzzfeed.
    computers crash because they have finite resources,and cpu cycles,and it somepoint
    routers drop data,or server starts using virtual space,and eventually server goes down.

    you can do autoscaling based on traffic,say if 80% of threshold crossed scale up and vice versa,this is called elastic in aws.

    downside: 
        security:
            giving whole data to someone elses computer.
        can use private cloud:
            like having your own servers.
        you need internet access to access it.
            hooks:
                reaction to some reaction,like everytime i push to github,grab from there to amazon,it is called continuous deployment.
                you run tests called continuous integration.
        latency
        
        trust
            note: github comes with github enterprise,you can run it on your  own server.
        if something goes down:
            you have no control over things.
        
        eg. somebody removed left-pad from node repository and when they did npm install in server it failed.hence cloud can be risky.

    cloud saves space,time and work and labour.
    servers can have 16 even 64 cpu's,and tens of gigabytes of Ram and terabytes of storage.

    on cloud we use virtualization,so we don't have one os running on one machine.
    and so resources are used appropriately. 

    in virualization one machines acts like many and hypervisor is a software this allows us to do so,a hypervisor can run on hardware or on host os.

    containerization is even light weight version of virtualization but containerization cannot replace virualtization as containers are just processes.

    computing :
        mean to solve any goal oriented activity.
        or an executing algorithm.
